# How to play
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeed in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

# Why I wrote this code
After entering into 2nd year, I was stuck in learning OOP programming. I didn't understand what object is, what class is... so I tried to learn those concepts by writing code. I tried to wrote tic-tac-toe game code. It was so hard to understand OOP's concept at fisrt, but I soon got used to it's concept.
